### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was fortunate to have access to a computer at an early age, which sparked my interest in technology. My fascination began with running games and soon evolved into solving computer issues for people around me, from installing operating systems to troubleshooting software. It became clear early on that my career would revolve around computers.

With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and a Masterâ€™s in Data Science, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation to excel in the field of Artificial Intelligence. What excites me the most is the mathematics behind algorithms and their real-world applications. My expertise spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Time Series Analysis.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer in the camera division of Samsung Electronics, where I focused on enhancing the camera pipeline for improved image processing.

Currently, Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer at Rahnavard Lab, where I work on creating computational, machine learning, and statistical methods to uncover actionable insights in health and disease using high-dimensional omics data. My work aims to identify biological patterns, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive impactful research.

If you are looking for collaborations in the field of data science and artificial intelligence, please reach out to me.
